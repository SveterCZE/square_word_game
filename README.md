# Square Word Game
This is my first project I am sharing on github :)

I have no IT background or education and I work as lawyer, so be kind with me :)

This is a simple game which works as follows:
1. Everything is contained in the square_word_game.py
2. Once you run it, it will select the language of the dictionary, either English or Czech. NOTE: I did not upload my dictionary files, because I was not able to confirm that they are open source. You need to supply your dictionary. The words must be separated by spaces.
3. The game will ask you to select a size of the square.
4. The game will ask you to select a minimum length of a word. This allows you to get rid of short words.
5. A randomly generated square appears.
6. You will be prompted to input the word you found in the square. If the guess is correct, the word will be removed from the square and replaced with zeros.
7. Once all words are removed from the square.

For the testing purposes, run the game as game(True). This will show you the words found in the square.
